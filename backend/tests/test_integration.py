Lesson 1: Introduction to Python
Lesson Link: https://example.com/python/lesson1
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types
Lesson Link: https://example.com/python/lesson2
In Python, variables are used to store data values. Unlike other programming languages,
Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Python supports various data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Lesson 3: Control Flow
Lesson Link: https://example.com/python/lesson3
Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed.
Python supports if-else statements, for loops, and while loops for controlling program flow.
The if statement is used to test a specific condition and execute code accordingly.

Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
Lesson Link: https://example.com/ml/lesson1
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to learn
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer
programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Lesson 2: Supervised Learning
Lesson Link: https://example.com/ml/lesson2
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data.
The algorithm makes predictions based on input data and is corrected by the teacher.
Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
